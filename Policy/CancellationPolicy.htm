            <span lang="EN-US">Though Epathshala’s payment reconciliation team works on a Daily
                basis except holidays, there are other organizations involved in processing of online
                transactions, which could result in delays in credit of refunds to customer account.
                Usually credit towards failed transaction will be made within 15 / 20 working days.
